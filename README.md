### Hi there 👋

My name is Arnau Mora (he/him), I was born in 2002. I've been passionate and studying programming since I can remember. I've tried almost every language and technology you can think of, and I love to try new things and tech as soon as it's released, but right now I focus on Android Development.

### 👨🏼‍💻 Work

I'm currently very happily working for [bitfire web engineering](https://github.com/bitfireAT/) on DAVx⁵, ICSx⁵ and lately a new PUSH standard for CalDAV, CardDAV and WebDAV! You can take a look at this on [the draft's repository](https://github.com/bitfireAT/webdav-push).

### 🏫 Study

I've studied a Bachelor's degree in CS at the IES Pare Vitòria in Alcoi, and I'm currently studying a Telecommunications degree in the Universitat Politècnica de València.

### 🖥️ Personal Projects

I'm always looking for new projects to work on, but right now my main project is Escalar Alcoià i Comtat, an app for Android (and soon for iOS as well), that works as a climbing guide for the zones where I live. All the source code for this app is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/Escalar-Alcoia-i-Comtat).

### 📲 My social media

I have all my social media accounts in [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/ArnyminerZ), but I'm mostly active over at [X](https://x.com/ArnyminerZ), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ArnyminerZ) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArnyminerZ).
